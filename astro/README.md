# Astro

- `/` - A static page (pre-rendered)

## Project Setup

- Start simple server `node server.js` on port 3001
- Install client dependencies `pnpm install`
- Start client `pnpm run dev`

## Project Structure

Astro looks for `.astro`, `.md`, or `.js` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components or layouts.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                | Action                                             |
