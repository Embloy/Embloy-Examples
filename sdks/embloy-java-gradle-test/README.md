Open a Terminal: Navigate to the root directory of your project where the gradlew file is located.

- Make the Gradle Wrapper Executable (if it's not already):

  ```sh
  chmod +x ./gradlew
  ```

- To build the project, use:

  ```sh
  ./gradlew build
  ```

- To run the application, use:
  ```sh
  ./gradlew run
  ```
